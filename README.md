* Project Description
---------------------

This repository contains the initial stage of building a clone of the AirBnB website. 
This stage implements a console interface, to create our data model, manage our Objects using the command-line interpreter. 
Console commands also allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. 
Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, we also store and persist objects between sessions.

* Command Line Interpretation
